## Design Philosophy

### Color Palette
- **Primary**: Warm sepia brown (#8B4513) - evokes aged paper and vintage postal materials
- **Secondary**: Soft cream (#F5F5DC) - represents parchment and letter paper

- **Background**: Warm off-white (#FEFEFE) - clean canvas that doesn't compete with content

### Typography
